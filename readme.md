# Real Estate Management App

This project is a **React Native** application designed for real estate agents to manage property listings and track their status (e.g., **active**, **process**, **sold**). It allows agents to easily manage their portfolio of properties, update statuses, and access details in real-time. The app uses **Supabase** for backend data handling and real-time updates.

- **Status Tracking**: Track the status of each property (Active, Process, Sold).
- **Owner Details**: Easily contact property owners with integrated phone linking.
- **Image Upload**: Upload images for each property listing.
- **Filter & Search**: Filter and search properties based on different criteria like size, price, and status.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Property details and statuses are updated in real-time using **Supabase subscriptions**.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: Framework for building native apps.
- **Expo Router**: For navigation between screens.
